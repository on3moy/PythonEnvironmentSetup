# Documentation on how to create virtual environments with Python
![Python](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png)  
System: Windows OS  
Language: Python  
Module: venv  

## Use Cases
- You have one version of [Python](https://python.org/)  
- You want to manage many libraries for that one version of Python.
- You are learning how to use virtual environments

## When not to use
- You have to use more than one version of Python  

### Note
You can still download and install multiple versions of Python within Windows OS and use.
- Will become increasingly difficult to manage.
- You will need to set up PATH(s) appropriately.
- Another solution is using a [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), a python library to manage python versions
    - This has limited functionality for Window OS users, not recommended
    - Best managed used with through UNIX/MacOS/Linux
